# SmileIn

Mobile attendance app using face recognition and smile detection for secure, real-time presence tracking. SmileIn enables students and staff to check in easily just by smiling at the camera.

> **Case Study:** D3 Information Technology 2022 Student

## 🚀 Features

✅ **Real-time Face Recognition**  
✅ **Smile Verification Before Check-in**  
✅ **Mobile & Web Dashboard Integration**  
✅ **Secure and User-friendly**  
✅ **Optimized for Low-resource Devices**

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

- `smilein-app` – Mobile app (React Native) for student attendance with face & smile verification.  
- `smilein-face-recognition` – Face recognition model and processing pipeline.  
- `smilein-smile-detection` – Smile detection model and pipeline.  
- `smilein-web` – Admin & instructor dashboard for attendance monitoring.

## 📷 How It Works

1. **Student opens the SmileIn app.**  
2. App detects **face** using camera.  
3. App verifies **smile** before capturing check-in photo.  
4. Attendance status is **immediately updated** on the web dashboard.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend Mobile:** React Native
- **Frontend Web:** Next.js (or React)
- **Backend API:** FastAPI
- **Machine Learning:** TensorFlow, TFLite, MobileNetV2, BlazeFace
- **Database:** PostgreSQL / Supabase / Railway

## 🎓 Case Study Context

This project was developed as a **capstone project** for **D3 Information Technology 2022 Students** to address manual attendance inefficiencies with a **modern, contactless solution** using machine learning.

## 📈 Goals

- Improve **accuracy and security** in student attendance.  
- Enable **easy and fast check-in** with a smile.  
- Provide **real-time monitoring** for lecturers/admin.  
- Support **online & offline** mode for campus environments.
